    # ###  Accessing the current launcher from ruby.
    #
    # If you need a reference to the current launcher in your ruby code.
    #
    # `Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.launcher`
    #
    # This is usually not required, but might be useful in `support/01_launch.rb`.
    #
    # ### Attaching to the current launcher in a console
    #
    # If Calabash already running and you want to attach to the current launcher,
    # use `console_attach`.  This is useful when a cucumber Scenario has failed and
    # you want to query the current state of the app.
    #
    # * **Pro Tip:** Set the `QUIT_APP_AFTER_SCENARIO=0` env variable so calabash
    # does not quit your application after a failed Scenario.
